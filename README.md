Hello. This is the first website project that I have created and uploaded online.
It basically is a quizgame website where you take a simple, common-knowledge quiz, then it displays your score and updates it whenever you
answer correctly or faslely. 
The main file you need to run for the entire website to work is "project1.html", where it displays the home page with the buttons that
lead you to other pages. (the quiz page and credit page, the "help" is just a popup not a page.)
Thats basicaly what my website is about !!
I hope you enjoy your time using it !!!!!

(ps. it does not display well with mobile and tablet dispaly screens)
(ps. the exit button doesnt work haha)
