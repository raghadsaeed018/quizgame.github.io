  <h1>Physical Geography of Japan</h1>
  
  <p1>
    Japan, an island country located in East Asia, is known for its unique physical geography. <br>
    It is situated in the Pacific Ocean and consists of four main islands: <br>Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku.
    The country is characterized by diverse <br> landforms and natural features. 
  </p>
  </p1>
  </div>
  <div class="all">
  <h2>- Mountains</h2>
  
  <p>
    Japan is mountainous, with about 70% of its land covered by <br> mountains. 
    The most famous and iconic mountain in Japan is <br> Mount Fuji,  a majestic volcano and a symbol of the country. 
    <br> Other notable mountain ranges include the Japanese Alps and <br> the Northern Japan Alps. 
    These mountains not only provide <br> breathtaking landscapes but also influence the climate <br>and hydrology of the region.
  </p>
  
  <h2>- Coastline</h2>

  <p>
    Japan has a long coastline stretching approximately 29,751 <br> kilometers. 
    It is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east and <br> the Sea of Japan to the west. 
    The coastline is characterized by <br> numerous bays, peninsulas, and offshore islands. 
    The Inland Sea, <br> located between Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu,  is a notable <br> feature that separates the islands.
    This coastal geography <br> contributes to Japan's rich marine biodiversity and influences its <br> climate.
  </p>
  
  <div class="right">
  <h2>Volcanoes and Hot Springs -</h2>
  
  <p>
    Due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan is prone <br> to volcanic activity. 
    It has more than 100 active volcanoes, including <br> Mount Aso, Mount Ontake, and Mount Asama.
    These volcanoes <br> have shaped the landscape and created natural wonders such as <br> volcanic craters, calderas, and hot springs (onsen).
    Hot springs <br> are an integral part of Japanese culture and provide opportunities <br> for relaxation and rejuvenation.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Rivers and Lakes -</h2>
  
  <img class="river" src="https://sainsbury-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img-Shinano-Jan-2013.jpg">
  <p>
    Japan has several rivers and lakes that play a vital role in its <br> geography.  
    The longest and most important river is the Shinano <br> River, which flows through central Honshu.
    Lake Biwa, located <br> in Shiga Prefecture, is the largest freshwater lake in Japan. <br>
    These water bodies not only provide scenic beauty but also <br> support agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and <br> water supply.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h2>- Climate</h2>

  <img class="temple" src="https://theworldpursuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Japan.jpeg">

  <p>
    Japan's climate is diverse, with four distinct seasons. Hokkaido <br> has cold winters with heavy snowfall, while Honshu 
    experiences <br> temperate weather throughout the year. The western regions have <br> milder temperatures with higher humidity,
     while the southern areas <br>have a subtropical climate with hot and humid summers. Coastal <br> areas are influenced by ocean 
     currents, and the mountainous terrain <br> contributes to varying weather patterns. Japan is also prone to <br> occasional extreme
      weather events such as typhoons and <br> experiences heavy snowfall in its mountainous regions during winter.
  </p>
  
  <br>

  <h2>- Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>
    Japan's physical geography, characterized by its mountains, coastline, <br>volcanoes, and water bodies, creates a diverse and captivating natural environment.
    <br> The unique features of the country have influenced its culture, economy, and way of life. <br>
    Exploring the physical beauty of Japan is an <br> incredible experience that showcases the wonders of nature.
